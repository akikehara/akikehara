I graduated from Drexel University in June 2022. I majored in Physics and double minored in Nuclear Engineering and STEM education. Throughout my years at
Drexel, I wrote many codes and programs for different projects and assignements. This page acts as a place to organize and reference for many different 
programs. The programs consist of: simulations, numerical analysis, and even some data analysis from the lab.
